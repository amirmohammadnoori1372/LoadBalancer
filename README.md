Hashing Algorithm : ELF

ELF

It is with this in mind that the implementation of ELF and similarly purposed hash functions are designed. In short: In a hashtable, the occasional collision is a price worth paying for a faster hash. In a cryptographic hash, a slow hash is a price worth paying for avoiding collisions
